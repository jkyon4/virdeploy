# virdeploy
My first project which aims is to apply Gradient to deploy a deep learning neural network. ;)

So what is GRADIENT?? 

Gradient is a Paperspace product that simplifies developing, training, and deploying deep learning models. The platform provides infrastructure automation and a software development kit for machine learning developers.

The rest of the steps I'll be following https://blog.paperspace.com/deploying-deep-learning-models-part-ii-hosting-on-paperspace/ !

Have a great day.
